 A hands-on analysis of Amazon marketplace data to understand pricing patterns and discount trends.
 Amazon Pricing & Discount Analysis

 About This Project

 This project explores product pricing and discount patterns within an Amazon marketplace dataset. The goal was to clean and structure raw data, then extract insights that     could help understand how discounts are applied across categories and how they relate to customer ratings.

 Instead of focusing only on visualization, I concentrated on building a clean dataset first and making sure calculations were accurate before drawing conclusions.

 What I Did

 Cleaned and standardized price and discount values
 Converted percentage fields into usable numeric formats
 Created new variables such as discount amount and discount rate
 Explored pricing distribution using log transformation
 Compared discount levels across product categories
 Examined the relationship between discount depth and customer ratings

 Tools & Technologies

 Python
 Pandas
 NumPy
 Matplotlib
 Jupyter Notebook

 Key Observations

 Price distribution was highly skewed before transformation
 Higher discounts did not consistently translate into better ratings
 Some categories showed repeated discount strategies

 Why This Project Matters

Understanding discount patterns can help businesses evaluate pricing strategies and promotional behavior. This project demonstrates my ability to clean structured data, build calculated fields, and extract insights through exploratory analysis.
