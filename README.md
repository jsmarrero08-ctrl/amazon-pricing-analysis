# Amazon Pricing & Discount Analysis (Python)

A hands-on exploratory data analysis project examining pricing patterns and discount behavior within an Amazon marketplace dataset.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes product pricing and discount trends using a structured Amazon dataset.  
The primary objective was to clean raw data, engineer meaningful variables, and identify patterns in pricing strategies across product categories.

The analysis emphasizes data preparation accuracy before drawing analytical conclusions.

---

## Objectives

- Clean and standardize pricing and discount fields  
- Convert percentage values into numeric formats  
- Engineer new variables such as discount amount and discount rate  
- Analyze pricing distribution using log transformation  
- Compare discount depth across product categories  
- Evaluate the relationship between discount levels and customer ratings  

---

## Key Insights

- Price distribution was highly skewed prior to transformation.  
- Higher discounts did not consistently correlate with higher customer ratings.  
- Certain product categories displayed repeated discount strategies.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Log transformation for distribution normalization  
- Comparative category-level analysis  
- Analytical interpretation of structured datasets
